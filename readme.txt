**Q: What languages do you support?**

A: So, you are not settling up for English speakers - wise move! Using our services, your Facebook store can talk in any language! (Note: your back office and dashboard would still talk to you in English, but if you are reading this we trust that this is OK for you...). See how to easily translate your Facebook store to any language.

**Q: What currencies do you support?**

A: We support any currency.

**Q: How do I open a Facebook fan page?**

A: Oh, this is exciting - a new page is going to be born really soon! Click here: http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php?campaign_id=372931622610&placement=pghm&extra_1=0
and fill out your company or product info. This one is really self explanatory - even Mark (Zuckerberg) didn't have much to say about it - see here.


**Q: Can I log in using my fan page and not my Facebook personal profile?**

A: Logging into StoreYa is done by connecting with Facebook using your personal profile (due to Facebook's limitations),
BUT - at the end of our very short import process, you will be provided with a link enabling you to connect your new Facebook store to a Facebook fan page of your choice (a fan page that you are its admin, of course). Your personal profile will serve you to log into your StoreYa back-office. There will be no connection between your store and your personal profile at Facebook's end.


**Q: How can I cancel my account?**

A: Leaving so soon? If there is anything we can do, or if you are willing to feedback us on the reasons that made you considering cancelling your account, please email support@storeya.com so we can learn and improve for the future.
To cancel your account with us, follow these easy steps:
1. Connect to StoreYa.com using Facebook connection.

2. Go to "Account > My Account" tab.

3. Click "Please cancel my account"

4. Confirm by clicking the delete button.
